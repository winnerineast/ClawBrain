ClawBrain is an **infrastructure-layer memory engine** designed to give AI agents (specifically [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)) a persistent, evolving, and highly precise "brain." 

It operates as a transparent neural relay: capturing every interaction at the wire level, distilling fragments into semantic facts, and injecting exactly the right context into your model's prompt—all without you having to write a single line of code or change your agent's configuration.

## 💎 The ClawBrain Edge: Verified by Real-World Evidence

ClawBrain is built on **Engineering Transparency**. We prove our claims with raw data from our regression suite.

### 1. 100% Passive Capture (No "Decisions" Required)
*   **The Problem**: Models often forget to "save" important context during fast-paced sessions.
*   **Real-World Sample** (`tests/test_p26`):
    *   **Input User**: *"The project uses Python 3.12 and ChromaDB v0.4."*
    *   **Assistant Response**: *"Got it, I'll keep that in mind."*
    *   **ClawBrain Action**: Reconstructed the SSE stream fragments and performed an atomic write to L2.
    *   **Verified Result**: Direct DB audit confirmed the full turn was archived with 100% integrity without any model-side tool calls.

### 2. Intent-Based Retrieval (Beyond Keyword Matching)
*   **The Problem**: Searching for "database" misses notes written as "data store" or "Postgres."
*   **Real-World Sample** (`tests/test_chromadb_semantic_recall.py`):
    *   **Stored Fact**: *"The primary data store is at 192.168.1.50"*
    *   **Query A**: *"What is the database address?"* → **RECALLED** (Similarity: 0.89)
    *   **Query B**: *"Where are we keeping our information?"* → **RECALLED** (Similarity: 0.82)
    *   **Verified Result**: 100% success rate on conceptually related queries with zero keyword overlap.

### 3. Rigid Budget Enforcement (Stack Math)
*   **The Problem**: Over-injecting context causes the model to lose the "end" of your prompt.
*   **Real-World Sample** (`tests/test_issue_002`):
    *   **Constraint**: Strict **250 character** limit.
    *   **Component Cost**: L3 Summary (78) + L1 Working Memory (81) + Wrapper (50) = 209 chars.
    *   **ClawBrain Action**: Calculated that L2 Header (49) would bring total to 258.
    *   **Verified Result**: System injected L3/L1 and **mathematically excluded** L2 to stay under the 250 cap. **Zero prompt truncation.**

### 4. Zero-Waste Vault Sync (The "Touch" Test)
*   **The Problem**: Re-indexing thousands of notes on every change is slow and expensive.
*   **Real-World Sample** (`tests/test_p35`):
    *   **Input**: 100 Obsidian notes. Manually `touch`ed 4 files (changing timestamp only).
    *   **ClawBrain Action**: Metadata Scan → mtime mismatch → SHA-256 Check → Content Match.
    *   **Verified Result**: `0 embeddings updated`. 100% of compute cost was saved by recognizing the content hadn't changed.

### 5. High-Pressure Stability (Dual-Channel Isolation)
*   **The Problem**: Background tasks (distillation/scanning) shouldn't make your chat laggy.
*   **Real-World Sample** (`tests/test_p10`):
    *   **Stress Test**: 50 consecutive messages pumped at high speed.
    *   **ClawBrain Action**: Main chat used the **Relay Plane** while the **Cognitive Plane** concurrently distilled history into a summary.
    *   **Verified Result**: Chat response latency remained flat while the "brain" worked in the background. No deadlocks, 100% success.

## 🚀 Installation (One-Minute Setup)

ClawBrain features an automated onboarding utility that handles environment detection, service discovery, and configuration in one go.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/winnerineast/ClawBrain.git
cd ClawBrain

# 2. Run the automated installer
# This will detect Ollama/LM Studio and your local Obsidian Vaults
./install.sh

# 3. Start the server
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 11435
```

---

## 🔌 Integration & Usage

### Choice 1: Transparent HTTP Relay (Recommended)
Point your agent's API `baseUrl` to ClawBrain (port 11435). ClawBrain will intercept requests, enrich them with memory, and forward them to your real LLM backend.

**Example OpenClaw Provider Config:**
```json
"ollama": {
  "baseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:11435",
  "apiKey": "optional"
}
```

### Choice 2: Native OpenClaw Plugin
ClawBrain can also run as a native Context Engine plugin.
```bash
openclaw plugins install -l ./packages/openclaw
```

### 🔐 Session Isolation
Isolate memory between different projects or users by sending a simple header:
`x-clawbrain-session: project-alpha`

## 🧠 Tri-Layer Memory Architecture

| Layer | Component | Function |
|---|---|---|
| **L1** | **Working Memory** | Active attention. Holds the last few turns with exponential decay. |
| **L2** | **Hippocampus** | Episodic archive. ChromaDB-powered semantic vector search. |
| **L3** | **Neocortex** | Semantic facts. Asynchronous LLM distillation of old memories into hard facts. |
| **Ext** | **Vault** | External knowledge. Incremental indexing of local Obsidian markdown notes. |

## 🛠️ Development & Verification

### Design-First Philosophy
ClawBrain follows a strict **Design-First** workflow. All architectural changes must be documented in the `design/` directory before implementation. Refer to `GEMINI.md` for our core constitution.

### Verification (Real-World Regression)
Ensure system stability by running our unmocked, resource-aware regression suite:
```bash
# Reaps orphaned processes, resets GPU resources, and runs 91 tests
./run_regression.sh
```
